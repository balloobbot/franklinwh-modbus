# FranklinWH Modbus Conformance & Compliance Scorecard

*Generated on: 2026-05-23 21:40:56*

## Device Metadata
- **Manufacturer**: FranklinWH Technologies Co., Ltd
- **Model**: aGate X
- **Serial Number**: 10060006A02F24170091
- **IP Address**: 192.168.0.110:502
- **Slave Unit ID**: 1

## Write plane Status (SPAN Modbus Lock)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🔒 WRITE PLANE LOCKED**: Proprietary extension registers are **read-only** (SPAN Modbus lock active). This is normal for standard FranklinWH installations that do not have SPAN/Lumin panels provisioned. Active power control (M704) remains fully writable.

## Extensions & Mirrors Audit
| Extension Register | Purpose | Live Status | Details |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `15506` (Home Load) | Coarse active home load in Watts (snaps to ~100W steps) | ❓ Unread | No telemetry returned |
| `15507` (Operating Mode) | Native mode control: 1=Backup, 2=Self-Consumption, 3=TOU, 4=Manual. Requires installer SPAN Modbus unlock to write. | ✅ Readable | Value: 2 |
| `15508` (Self-Consumption Reserve) | Self-consumption floor reserve percentage. Requires installer SPAN Modbus unlock to write. | ✅ Readable | Value: 6 |
| `15509` (TOU Reserve) | Time-of-Use floor reserve percentage. Firmware defect: register always mirrors 15508 and cannot be configured independently via Modbus. | ✅ Readable | Value: 6 |
| `16000` (High-Resolution Home Load) | Undocumented high-precision home load mirror in Watts (~1W resolution vs ~100W). Used preferentially by the library. | ✅ Readable | Value: 454 |

## Safety & Orchestration Recommendations
1. **Software watchdogs are mandatory**: Since `WSetRvrtTms` countdown does not revert power setpoints and `ControllerHb` is non-functional, always provide safe timeouts `duration_s` on all power commands.
2. **Calculated Current**: `M714.DCA` is 0. Use calculated current: `I = Power / Voltage`.
3. **Battery State**: `M713.Sta` is 0. Rely on dynamic power direction: Positive is charging, negative is discharging.
4. **Reserve Controls**: Extension write registers are read-only. For battery throttling and reserve limits, rely entirely on the library's **software-based Virtual Mode Controller (VMC)**.
