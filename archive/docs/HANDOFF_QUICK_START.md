# Quick Start for Next Session

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-01  
**Status:** Core library stable, Phase 2 in progress

---

## What's Been Completed (Recent)

### ✅ SoC Validation Safety (GAP-1, GAP-2)
- Reserve SoC conflict detection implemented
- 5% safety margin enforcement
- Extension registers 15507-15509 integration
- Documents: `SOC_VALIDATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `TRACEABILITY_SOC_VALIDATION.md`

### ✅ Band-Aid Conflict Detection
- Context-aware conflict detection (solar/load/grid)
- Reduces ~80% of false positives
- Energy Flow display in CLI status
- Separates INFO messages from true CONFLICTS

### ✅ TUI Monitor (PARKED)
- Rich-based terminal dashboard implemented
- 5 themes, keyboard controls, auto-quiet mode
- Status: PARKED pending user validation

## Current State

### Phase 2.2: Virtual Mode Testing ⚠️ IN PROGRESS

| Mode | Status | Next Action |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Manual | ✅ Complete | None needed |
| Self-Consumption | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Hardware test required |
| Emergency Backup | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Hardware test required |
| Time-of-Use | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Hardware test required |
| Peak Shave | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Hardware test required |

**Next Priority:** Test Self-Consumption mode on real hardware

## Quick Commands

### Check Status with Energy Context
```bash
cd /home/david/dev/modbus
python3 franklinwh_cli.py -i 192.168.0.110 --status
```

### Test Self-Consumption Mode
```bash
# Set reserve and target
cd /home/david/dev/modbus
python3 franklinwh_cli.py -i 192.168.0.110 \
  --mode self_consumption \
  --reserve 20 \
  --target-soc 95 \
  --duration 3600 \
  --reset-on-start
```

### Dry Run (No Commands Sent)
```bash
python3 franklinwh_cli.py -i 192.168.0.110 --max-charge --dry-run
```

## Common User Requests

### If User Says "Test Virtual Modes"
→ Test Self-Consumption mode first (most common use case)  
→ See `PHASES_AND_ROADMAP.md` Phase 2.2

### If User Says "Conflict Detection Still Has Issues"
→ Remind: Full Option 2 (intent-based) queued for Phase 3  
→ Band-aid fix already implemented reduces false positives  
→ See `CONFLICT_DETECTION_ANALYSIS.md`

### If User Says "Resume TUI Monitor"
→ TUI is PARKED but ready to unpark  
→ See `TODO_TUI_TERMINAL_MONITOR.md`  
→ May need testing with/without rich library

### If User Says "What's Next?"
→ Virtual Mode Testing (Phase 2.2)  
→ See `PHASES_AND_ROADMAP.md`
