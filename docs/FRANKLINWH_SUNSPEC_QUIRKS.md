# FranklinWH aGate SunSpec Implementation Quirks

Documenting non-standard behaviors, missing registers, and implementation-specific issues discovered during development.

---

## Model 713 - DER Storage Capacity

### Sta (Status) Register Always 0

**Issue:** The `Sta` register in Model 713 always returns 0 (OFF) regardless of actual battery state.

**SunSpec 2 M713.Sta enum:**
| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | OFF |
| 1 | EMPTY |
| 2 | DISCHARGING |
| 3 | CHARGING |
| 4 | FULL |
| 5 | HOLDING |
| 6 | TESTING |

**Observed:** Battery actively charging at -400W (M714.DCW), SoC 79% — M713.Sta remains 0 (OFF).

**Workaround:** Derive battery state from M714 DCW power direction (±50W deadband):
```python
# M714.DCW sign convention (confirmed empirically 2026-03-10):
#   positive = power INTO battery (Charging)
#   negative = power OUT of battery (Discharging)
if dc_power > 50:
    state = 'CHARGING'
elif dc_power < -50:
    state = 'DISCHARGING'
else:
    state = 'IDLE'
```

**Code Location:** `src/franklinwh_modbus/controller.py:read_battery_status()` — returns `battery_state` (derived) and `status_raw` (M713.Sta, always 0)

---

## Model 714 - Battery DC Measurements

### DCA (DC Current) Register Not Populated
**Issue:** The DCA register in Model 714 returns 0 or is not implemented.

**Standard SunSpec Model 714 Fields:**
- `DCW` - DC Power (W) ✅ **Working** — positive=charging (into battery), negative=discharging (out of battery)
- `DCV` - DC Voltage (V) ✅ **Working** 
- `DCA` - DC Current (A) ❌ **Not populated (returns 0)**
- `Tmp` - Battery Temperature (°C) ✅ **Working**
- `DCWhInj` - DC Energy Injected (Wh) ✅ **Working** — lifetime discharged
- `DCWhAbs` - DC Energy Absorbed (Wh) ✅ **Working** — lifetime charged

**Workaround:** Calculate current from Power/Voltage:
```python
dc_current = dc_power / dc_voltage  # Ohm's Law: I = P/V
```

**Code Location:** `src/franklinwh_modbus/controller.py:read_battery_status()` (M714 section)

---

## Model 701 - Inverter Measurements

### TmpAmb and TmpCab Implementation
**Status:** ✅ **Working as of aGate firmware**

FranklinWH aGate X implements these temperature registers:
- `TmpAmb` (40105) - Ambient temperature
- `TmpCab` (40106) - Cabinet temperature

Earlier firmware versions may not expose these.

## Extension Registers (15500-15513) — Documented

FranklinWH provides proprietary extension registers beyond standard SunSpec:

| Address | Register | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| 15500-15501 | PV Installed flags | ✅ Working | Not actively used |
| 15502-15505 | Solar breakdown | ✅ Working | PV Total, Proximal, Remote 1/2 (W) |
| 15506 | Home Load | ✅ Working | Active load in W |
| 15507 | Operating Mode | ✅ Working | 0=Emergency, 1=TOU, 2=Self-Consumption, 3=Manual |
| 15508 | Self-Consumption Reserve | ✅ Working | Reserve SOC % |
| 15509 | TOU Reserve | ⚠️ **Known defect** | Always mirrors 15508 — see below |
| 15510-15513 | PV Energy | ✅ Working | Total/Proximal Wh (uint32 high:low pairs) |

> **Note:** Write access to 15507-15509 requires **SPAN Modbus** unlock in FranklinWH installer app.

### SOC Reserve Registers — Known Defect

Registers 15508 (Self-Consumption Reserve) and 15509 (TOU Reserve) **always return the same value**, even when set differently in the FranklinWH app. This is a known firmware defect documented in the SPAN tab of the official SunSpec PICS file.

### Official SunSpec PICS Reference

FranklinWH's SunSpec Alliance certification document is at:
`docs/UPDATED_FranklinWH_Modbus_PICS_SM-000028.xlsx`

This XLSX documents:
- "Unimplemented" info points (using base address 1)
- Extension register definitions (SPAN tab)
- The SOC reserve defect

> [!WARNING]
> **We do not fully trust this document.** Our live testing has found discrepancies between what the PICS document claims and actual aGate behavior. Always verify against the live device. Use the PICS as a starting point, not ground truth.

See: `docs/VERIFICATION_BASELINE.md` for full register map and cross-verification.

## Extension Registers (15000-15039) — Undocumented

Discovered by accident (typo of 15500). Proprietary registers — likely aPower battery telemetry mirrors. See `docs/VERIFICATION_BASELINE.md` Section 4 for full dump.

Notable high-confidence matches:
- `15020` = 13600 → exact match to `713.WHRtg` (battery energy rating)
- `15036` = 961 → exact match to `713.SoH` raw (96.1%)
- `15024` = ~50010 → grid frequency mirror (~50.0Hz)
- `15025` = ~2420 → grid voltage mirror (~242.0V)

**Write-probe (2026-03-08):** All 40 registers accept writes at protocol level but ALL are silently discarded. No sticky registers found. See `tests/results/2026-03-08_extension_write_probe.md`.

**Unit ID scan:** All unit IDs (1-247 sampled) return the same aGate X device (DA=1). No hidden sub-devices.

> **Caution:** These are undocumented and may change with firmware updates.

> **Future TODO:** Overnight brute-force scan of address ranges 15040-15499 and 16000-20000+ for additional populated register ranges. The 15000 range was found by accident — there may be more. Scan ~5000 addresses at 100ms each ≈ 8 minutes.

---

## Model 704 - Battery Control

### WSet vs WSetPct Sign Convention
**Issue:** Hardware uses inverted sign convention for WSetPct.

| Parameter | Software Convention | Hardware Convention |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| `WSet` | Positive=Charge | Positive=Charge |
| `WSetPct` | Positive=Charge | **Negative=Charge** |

**Workaround:** Always invert WSetPct value when writing:
```python
m704.WSetPct.value = -pct_raw  # Invert for hardware
```

---

## ⚠️ Write Access Asymmetry & VPP Mode Handoff

> **This is the most significant implementation quirk affecting library design.**

### Control Architecture: VPP Mode Clean Handoff

When `WSetEna=1` is written to M704, the aGate **automatically activates VPP Mode** (exclusive remote control). This is a **clean handoff**, not a split-brain architecture:

1. **`WSetEna=1`** → aGate activates VPP Mode, native mode (Self-Consumption/TOU) is **suspended**
2. **M704 commands** control battery power exclusively while VPP is active
3. **`WSetEna=0`** → VPP deactivates, native mode **cleanly resumes**

See [VPP_MODE_REFERENCE.md](VPP_MODE_REFERENCE.md) for the VPP Mode visual reference.

### Write Access Table

| Control Plane | Registers | Read | Write | What It Controls |
|---------------|-----------|------|-------|------------------|
| **SunSpec M704** | 40318-40354 | ✅ | ✅ | Battery power via VPP Mode (WSet, WSetPct, WSetEna) |
| **FranklinWH Extensions** | 15507-15509 | ✅ | ❌ Read-Only* | Operating mode, SoC reserves |
| **M702 Rate Settings** | 40259-40262 | ✅ | ❌ (tested 2026-03-13) | Charge/discharge rate limits |

*Extension write access requires **SPAN Modbus** unlock — enabled by FranklinWH Support for SPAN panel owners.

### What This Means in Practice

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ We CAN do (SunSpec M704):              WE CANNOT do:        │
│ ✅ Charge battery at 3000W             ❌ Change mode to TOU │
│ ✅ Discharge battery at 2000W          ❌ Set reserve to 30% │
│ ✅ Set idle (stop charge/discharge)    ❌ Switch to Backup   │
│ ✅ Read all status + extensions        ❌ Change any mode    │
│ ✅ Release control (native resumes)    ❌ Set PCS rate limits│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### SunSpec2 Compliance Matrix

> See [SUNSPEC_DER_SEQUENCING_REFERENCE.md](./SUNSPEC_DER_SEQUENCING_REFERENCE.md) for proper phased sequencing protocol.

| Feature | SunSpec2 Spec | FranklinWH Reality | Library Workaround | Vendor Fix? |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| LocRemCtl handoff | Remote (0) enables writes | Always Local (1), read-only; yet M704 writes work | None needed — power writes accepted despite Local | Report as spec deviation |
| Controller heartbeat | Client writes ControllerHb; DER monitors | ❌ Confirmed non-functional (write accepted, readback=0) | Not implemented — no alternative | Report as defect |
| Reversion timer (WSetRvrtTms) | DER counts down, auto-reverts power | ✅ **WORKS with proper sequencing!** Timer=60s accepted, countdown active (59→55→52) | Software `threading.Timer` via `duration_s` (may become optional) | N/A — working correctly |
| Reversion enable (WSetEnaRvrt) | Enables reversion behavior | ✅ **WORKS!** Readback=1 after write | N/A | N/A — working correctly |
| Battery state (M713.Sta) | Reflects CHARGING/DISCHARGING/IDLE | Always 0 (OFF) | Derived from M714.DCW ±50W deadband | Report; workaround is robust |
| DC Current (M714.DCA) | Reports battery DC current | Always 0 | Calculated: I = P/V from DCW/DCV | Report; workaround is robust |
| Ramp rate (WRmp) | Smooths power transitions | Returns None (unimplemented) | Software SoC ramp via `--soc-ramp-window` | Report; software ramp is different concept |
| Extension register writes | N/A (vendor-specific) | Read-only without SPAN Modbus unlock | Cloud API bypass (Tier 2) for mode changes | SPAN unlock required; vendor provisioning |
| VPP Mode activation | WSetEna=1 starts remote DER control | ✅ Works — activates VPP Mode (exclusive) | None needed — works as intended | N/A — working correctly |
| Command persistence | WSetRvrtTms reverts after timeout | WSetRvrtTms countdown active; WSetEna persists after timer expiry (partial implementation?) | Software timer + `reset_control_state()` remains recommended | Investigate: does countdown actually revert power? |
| Throttle % (ThrotPct) | Reports inverter power curtailment % | ✅ Readable (40180), always 0% in testing | None — read-only info point | N/A — may activate under thermal/grid stress |
| Throttle source (ThrotSrc) | Bitfield of throttle cause | 0xFFFFFFFF (unimplemented) | Not implemented — no alternative | Report; no workaround possible |
| Grid charge/discharge limits | `WChaRteMax` / `WDisChaRteMax` (RW per spec) | ❌ Confirmed: registers return 0xFFFF, writes silently discarded even with VPP + proper sequencing | Cloud API `setPowerControl` is only path | Report as defect |
| VA charge/discharge limits | `VAChaRteMax` / `VADisChaRteMax` (RW per spec) | ❌ Confirmed: 0xFFFF, writes discarded | Cloud API only | Report as defect |
| Max power limit (WMaxLimPct) | Caps inverter output at % of rated | ❌ **Confirmed non-functional.** WMaxLimPctEna write silently discarded (readback=0). WMaxLimPct readable (1000) but enable never sticks | Not implemented | Report as defect |
| Reactive power enable (VarSetEna) | Enables reactive power control | ❌ **Confirmed non-functional.** Write accepted, readback=0 (silently discarded). VarSetMod/VarSetPri readable but VarMaxInj/Abs=0xFFFF | Not implemented | Report as defect |

> **Test methodology:** All features re-tested 2026-03-13 using proper SunSpec 6-phase protocol (Pre-flight → Mode → Safety → Setpoint → Enable → Verify) with 200-500ms inter-phase settling. See [SUNSPEC_DER_SEQUENCING_REFERENCE.md](./SUNSPEC_DER_SEQUENCING_REFERENCE.md).

### Crash-Orphan Risk

> [!CAUTION]
> If the consumer application crashes while `WSetEna=1`, the aGate remains in VPP Mode indefinitely. There is no hardware timeout to auto-revert (WSetRvrtTms behavior unverified). The library provides `reset_control_state()` for graceful shutdown, but **crash recovery is a consumer responsibility**, not a library concern.

### The LocRemCtl Paradox (Model 715) — TESTED 2026-03-08

Model 715 `LocRemCtl` (addr 1089 base-1) reports `1` = **Local Control** and is **read-only**.

**Per SunSpec 2 spec:**
- `LocRemCtl = 1` (Local) → DER should **reject ALL** Modbus client writes
- `LocRemCtl = 0` (Remote) → DER accepts write commands from Modbus clients

**FranklinWH violates this fundamentally.** The aGate:
- ✅ Accepts M704 power writes (WSetEna, WSetPct, WSetMod) despite being in Local mode
- ❌ Ignores M715 lifecycle writes (ControllerHb — **confirmed non-functional** even with proper sequencing)
- ✅ **WSetRvrtTms WORKS** with proper sequencing (countdown active, 59→55→52)

This creates a **selective-write hybrid** that is non-standard:

| Feature | SunSpec 2 Expectation (Local) | FranklinWH Actual |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Power writes (WSetPct) | ❌ Reject | ✅ Accepts |
| Power enable (WSetEna) | ❌ Reject | ✅ Accepts |
| Reversion config (WSetRvrtTms) | ❌ Reject | ✅ Accepts value |
| Reversion countdown (WSetRvrtRem) | N/A | ✅ **Active!** Counts down correctly (59→55→52) |
| Controller heartbeat (ControllerHb) | ❌ Reject | ❌ **Confirmed non-functional** (write accepted, readback=0) |
| DER heartbeat (DERHb) | N/A | ❌ Always 0 |
| LocRemCtl write | Allow | ❌ Read-only |

**Test evidence:** See `tests/results/2026-03-08_p1_control_tests.md`

### Design Implications

1. **VPP Mode provides clean control handoff:** When `WSetEna=1`, the aGate suspends native mode and grants exclusive Modbus control. This is cooperative, not conflicting.

2. **Hardware reversion timer available:** WSetRvrtTms **works** — the aGate counts down and (potentially) reverts the power setpoint. However, WSetEna may persist after timer expiry. Further investigation needed on whether power actually reverts or just the countdown is cosmetic.

3. **ControllerHb remains non-functional:** Even with proper sequencing, heartbeat writes are silently discarded. Software watchdog (`duration_s` / `--revert`) remains the primary safety mechanism.

4. **Virtual modes operate within VPP Mode:** Our virtual Self-Consumption/TOU/Peak-Shave modes work by calculating power targets and issuing M704 commands while VPP Mode is active.

4. **Library vs consumer boundary:** The library exposes `send_command()` and `reset_control_state()`. Crash recovery, watchdog timers, and session lifecycle are **consumer responsibilities** (e.g. FEM's `ModbusControlService`).

5. **SPAN Modbus Unlock Changes Everything:** If write access to extensions is enabled, the library could fully control the aGate — changing modes, setting reserves, etc. This is a fundamentally different operating mode that the library should detect and adapt to.

### Detection of Write Capability

```python
# The library tests write capability during connect()
# by attempting a write to extension registers
def _probe_extension_writable(self):
    """Test if extension registers accept writes."""
    try:
        # Read current value, write it back, verify
        current = read_register(15508)  # SelfReserve
        write_register(15508, current)  # Write same value
        return True  # SPAN Modbus unlock is active
    except:
        return False  # Standard read-only
```

## SunSpec2 Client — Address Remapping

**Issue:** The SunSpec2 Python library (`sunspec2.modbus.client.ModbusClientTCP`) remaps register addresses internally. The `client.read()` method adjusts addresses based on SunSpec model base offsets, causing "Modbus exception 2" (illegal address) when attempting to read FranklinWH proprietary extension registers (15000+ and 15500+).

The SunSpec2 client also does **not** expose `read_holding_registers()` — it has only `read()` and `_read()`.

**Workaround:** Use raw Modbus TCP socket for all extension register reads:
```python
import struct
client = self.dev.client
sock = client.socket
req = struct.pack('>HHHBBHH', 0, 0, 6, unit_id, 3, start_addr, count)
sock.settimeout(self.timeout)  # Important for WiFi networks
sock.sendall(req)
resp = sock.recv(256)
```

**Code Location:** `src/franklinwh_modbus/controller.py:_read_extension_solar()`, `read_native_mode()`

## Register Addressing — Base-0 vs Base-1 vs Base-40000 (TESTED 2026-03-15)

### The Problem

FranklinWH aGate has **one SunSpec register map** but it responds at multiple base addresses. Different code paths must use different bases depending on whether they go through sunspec2 or raw Modbus TCP.

### The Three Address Spaces

| Layer | Base | Used By | Example: ControllerHb | Result |
|-------|:----:|---------|:----------------------:|:------:|
| **SunSpec PDU** | 0 | pymodbus `read_holding_registers(addr=0)` | Read addr 1092 | ✅ Works |
| **SunSpec base-1** | 1 | Raw TCP `struct.pack(...)`, FranklinWH XLSX | Read addr 1092 | ✅ Works |
| **Modbus 4xxxx** | 40000 | Traditional Modbus tools, some pymodbus configs | Read addr 41092 | ❌ ILLEGAL_DATA_ADDRESS |

**Why base-1 matters:** The SunSpec standard conventionally uses "1-based" register numbering in documentation (register 40001 = PDU address 0). FranklinWH's XLSX specification lists all addresses as base-1. When using raw TCP sockets, addresses are **PDU addresses** (0-based), which happen to equal the base-1 SunSpec addresses minus 1 for standard models — but for extension registers (15500+), the raw TCP address **IS** the base-1 address.

### What Works Where

```
Standard SunSpec models (M1–M715):
  ├── sunspec2 library:     base_address=0 (auto-scan)  → ✅ WORKS
  ├── pymodbus base 0:      address=0 through 1125      → ✅ WORKS
  ├── Raw TCP socket:       address=0 through 1125      → ✅ WORKS
  └── pymodbus base 40000:  address=40000+               → ❌ EXCEPTION 2

Extension registers (15500+):
  ├── sunspec2 library:     N/A — can't address these    → ❌ REMAPS
  ├── Raw TCP socket:       address=15500, 15507 etc.    → ✅ WORKS (base-1)
  └── pymodbus base 40000:  address=55500+               → ❌ EXCEPTION 2
```

### Which Code MUST Use Raw TCP (Base-1)

| Function | File | Registers | Why Raw TCP? |
|----------|------|-----------|--------------|
| `_read_extension_solar()` | controller.py:657 | 15500–15513 | sunspec2 can't address extensions |
| `read_native_mode()` | controller.py:773 | 15507–15509 | sunspec2 can't address extensions |
| `_test_extension_writability()` | controller.py:181 | 15507–15509 | Non-SunSpec proprietary registers |
| `_check_orphaned_vpp()` | controller.py:130 | M704.WSetEna (318) | Uses sunspec2 model read ✅ |

### Which Code Uses sunspec2 (Base-0 Auto)

| Function | Models | Addressing |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| `connect()` / `scan()` | All M1–M715 | sunspec2 auto-discovers at base 0 |
| `send_command()` | M704 | sunspec2 model write (handles addressing) |
| `read_battery_status()` | M713, M714 | sunspec2 model read |
| `read_grid_status()` | M701 | sunspec2 model read |
| All VPP control | M704, M715 | sunspec2 model read/write |

### Why sunspec2 Uses Base 0

```python
# In controller.py __init__:
base_address: int = 0  # sunspec2 uses 0 for auto/scan

# sunspec2 SunSpecModbusClientDeviceTCP.scan() does:
# 1. Reads address 0 → finds "SunS" header
# 2. Walks model chain from offset 2
# 3. Stores model addresses internally
# 4. All subsequent model reads use internal offsets
```

When `base_address=0`, sunspec2 **auto-discovers** by reading the SunSpec header at PDU address 0. It then manages all model addressing internally. You never need to know the absolute address — just `self.models[704][0].WSetEna.value`.

### UID Aliasing (Discovered 2026-03-15)

The aGate ignores the Modbus UID field entirely — **all UIDs respond identically**:

| UID | Base 0 | Base 40000 | Base 50000 |
|:---:|:------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| 1 | ✅ Same 17 models | ⚠️ Varies | ❌ |
| 2 | ✅ Same 17 models | ⚠️ Varies | ❌ |
| 3 | ✅ Same 17 models | ⚠️ Varies | ❌ |
| 126 | ✅ Same 17 models | ⚠️ Varies | ❌ |
| 247 | ✅ Same 17 models | ⚠️ Varies | ❌ |

We use `unit_id=2` (FranklinWH default) but any UID works. No per-UID register partitioning exists.

### Rules for New Code

1. **Standard SunSpec reads/writes → use sunspec2 model access** (never raw addresses)
2. **Extension registers (15000+/15500+) → raw TCP with base-1 addresses**
3. **Never use base 40000** — the device returns ILLEGAL_DATA_ADDRESS
4. **UID doesn't matter** — but use `unit_id=2` for consistency with FranklinWH docs

## Register 16000 — High-Resolution Home Load (Discovered 2026-03-15)

**Discovered:** 2026-03-15 (accidental typo) · **Severity:** Beneficial · **Status:** IN USE

An undocumented register block at 16000–16002 mirrors extension registers 15506–15509 but with **higher precision on the home load reading:**

| Register | Value | Mirrors | Precision |
|:--------:|:-----:|:-------:|:---------:|
| **16000** | Home Load (W) | 15506 | **~1W** (vs ~100W quantized) |
| 16001 | Self Reserve (%) | 15508 | Same |
| 16002 | TOU Reserve (%) | 15509 | Same |

### Correlation Evidence

```
    Time |  16000 (hires)  15506 (quantized)
-----------+----------------------------------
12:51:14 |    1004 W         1000 W
12:51:21 |     929 W          900 W
12:51:29 |     812 W          800 W
12:51:34 |     835 W          800 W
```

Register 16000 varies continuously while 15506 snaps to ~100W steps. The wider scan (15900–16100) found **no other non-zero registers** — this is an isolated 3-register block.

### Usage

The library now reads register 16000 as the primary home load source, falling back to 15506 if the high-res read fails. See `_read_extension_solar()` in `controller.py`.

**Risk:** This register is undocumented and could change with firmware updates. The fallback to 15506 mitigates this.

## Model 502 — Power Rounding (Scale Factor Quantization)

**Discovered:** 2026-03-12 · **Severity:** Low (cosmetic) · **Reported to:** FranklinWH Support

FranklinWH aGate SunSpec registers round power values to coarse resolution (~100W steps) due to integer registers with limited scale factors. Small power flows are quantized upward, making them appear much larger than actual.

**Example:** Enphase Envoy S Metered standby draw (~50-100W parasitic load on the PV circuit at night) appears as **500-600W of "solar generation"** in both Modbus (`M502.OutPw`) and Cloud API readings. The aGate is the source of truth for both, so the coarse value propagates everywhere.

**Impact:**
- Solar power entities show non-zero values at night (confusing but not harmful)
- `--status` shows `Solar: 500W Producing` when actual solar generation is 0W
- Home load calculation (`(calc)`) is inflated by the phantom solar component
- Energy totals may include phantom solar contribution from parasitic loads

**No software fix possible** — the quantization happens in aGate firmware before the registers are read. The Cloud API mirrors the same coarse values since both originate from the aGate's internal metering.

**Possible future mitigation:** Time-based solar gating (zero solar output between sunset and sunrise) or a configurable dead-band threshold. Neither is implemented yet.

---

## Serial Number Structure

FranklinWH serial numbers encode device type, hardware revision, and unique ID:

```
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
│       │  │        │
│       │  │        └── Unique serial (last 8 chars)
│       │  └─────────── Hardware revision (3 chars, e.g. "A02")
│       └────────────── Device type prefix
└────────────────────── Full serial (20 chars)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Hardware revision determines capabilities — some revs have more/fewer functions
- Extract rev from serial: `serial[8:11]` (e.g. `"A02"`)
- Example: aGate `A02` vs `A03` may differ in supported Modbus registers
- Available from `M1.SN` (Model 1 Common, address 40052)

---

## Model 704 — Hardware Reversion is Cosmetic (PICS Issue 4)

**Issue:** WSetRvrtTms (327) countdown works (30→0), but **does NOT revert power** at expiry. WSetEna and WSetPct are unchanged 186 seconds post-expiry. The SunSpec dead-man switch is non-functional.

**Evidence:** 186s extended observation, WSetRvrtTms=1 (1s edge case) also non-functional. Corroborated by FranklinWH app (VPP persisted), MQTT, and Home Assistant.

**Severity:** CRITICAL — combined with non-functional ControllerHb (1092), there is **zero hardware safety mechanism** on this firmware.

**Workaround:** Software-only dead-man via `send_command(duration_s=N)` in `controller.py`:
```python
# Software timeout is the ONLY safety mechanism
ctrl.send_command(BatteryCommand(-5000), duration_s=300)  # 5min auto-release
```

**Code Location:** `controller.py` — `send_command()` docstring documents this explicitly.

**Full Details:** [`PICS_CONFORMANCE_CROSS_REFERENCE.md`](./PICS_CONFORMANCE_CROSS_REFERENCE.md) — Issue 4

## Model 704 — No Input Validation on WSet/WSetPct (PICS Issue 5)

**Issue:** The device accepts WSet=15000W (150% of WMaxRtg=10000W) and WSetPct=±1500 (±150%) without Modbus exception, alarm, or clamping. Values read back exactly as written.

**Severity:** HIGH — downstream clamping status unknown. Software must enforce range limits.

**Workaround:** Two layers of clamping in the library:
1. `BatteryCommand.__post_init__()` — clamps to ±10000W at construction time
2. `controller._validate_power()` — clamps to device-reported WMaxRtg at write time

**Code Location:** `types.py` and `controller.py`

## Model 704 — Reactive Power Not Controllable (All Paths Exhausted)

**Issue:** No Modbus-accessible reactive power or PF control path exists on this firmware.

**Paths tested:**
| Path | Register | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| VarSetEna (331) | M704 | Silently discards all writes — 0/160 tests |
| PFWInjEna (298) | M704 | Writable but PF setpoints (267/268) are 0xFFFF |
| CtrlModes FIXED_VAR | M702 | Firmware claims available but no Modbus path |

**Conclusion:** The device manages reactive power internally. This is **final** — no further investigation paths remain.

## General Notes

- **Scale Factors:** Always read SF registers dynamically — they can change
- **Model Discovery:** aGate implements models 1, 502, 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715
- **Write Sequencing:** All SunSpec DER control groups require proper phased sequencing (Phase 0-5). See [SUNSPEC_DER_SEQUENCING_REFERENCE.md](./SUNSPEC_DER_SEQUENCING_REFERENCE.md)
- **Timing:** Minimum 100-500ms inter-phase settling. aGate round-trip ~98ms average. Do not rapid-fire writes.
- **Timeout:** WiFi networks to the aGate can be slow; always use configurable timeout (default 10s)
- **Addressing:** M715 registers accessible only at base-1 addresses. M704 works at both base-1 and base-40000.
