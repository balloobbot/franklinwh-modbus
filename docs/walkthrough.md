# Walkthrough: SunSpec Sequencer Transactional Verification

## Goal
Implement **Differentiated Transactional Verification** in the `SunSpecSequencer` to eliminate **False Positives** and ensure rigorous **State Transition Validation**.

## Changes Made

### Core Library: `src/franklinwh_modbus/sequencer.py`
*   **Transition-Aware Verification**: Modified `execute_writes` to capture `initial_value` before any Modbus transactions.
*   **Transactional Gating**: Write operations are now bypassed if `initial_value == target_value`, with the result labeled as `[MATCHED - NO TRANSITION]`.
*   **Standardized Labeling**: Differentiated between `[VERIFIED]` (successful transition) and `[MATCHED - NO TRANSITION]` (pre-existing state).
*   **Mandatory Transition Validation**: Added `TransitionValidationError` and support for the `require_transition` schema flag to enforce hardware state changes during conformance testing.

### Governance & Onboarding
*   **[NORMATIVE_REFERENCE_MASTER.md](file:///Users/davidhona/.gemini/antigravity/brain/caabe7a8-880e-4e0e-a695-af48b8dde79e/NORMATIVE_REFERENCE_MASTER.md)**: Codified **Plain Technical Business English** and formal diagnostic labeling as mandatory standards.
*   **[ONBOARDING.md](file:///Users/davidhona/dev/modbus/ONBOARDING.md)**: Established mandatory professional and technical standards for all agents entering the workspace.

## Verification Results

### Logic Validation
*   **Transition Case**: Verified that `Initial != Target` results in a write operation and a `[VERIFIED]` status.
*   **Static Case**: Verified that `Initial == Target` results in a bypassed write and a `[MATCHED - NO TRANSITION]` status.
*   **Requirement Case**: Verified that `require_transition: true` raises a `TransitionValidationError` when no transition is possible.

### Reporting Standards
*   Eliminated all informal terminology (e.g., "Ghost Pass," "Phase-Shift").
*   Standardized all diagnostic output to **Plain Technical Business English**.
